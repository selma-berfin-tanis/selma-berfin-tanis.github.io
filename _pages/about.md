Hi all!
I am currently a MSc student in Cognitive Psychology program at Sabanci University, working in Culture, Language, & Autobiographical Memory (CLAM) Lab under supervision of my advisor [Cagla Aydin](https://psy.sabanciuniv.edu/en/faculty_members/detail/1980). I am broadly interested in episodic memory, in particular association between linguistic cues and episodic memory processes in diverse socio-cultural settings.
